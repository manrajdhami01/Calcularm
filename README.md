# Project - *Calcularm*

**Calcularm** is an android alarm clock app that allows a user the functionality to set alarms, and repeat the alarms on selected days of the week. The twist, 
or difference from conventional alarm apps, is that when the alarm is triggered, it asks the user to solve a randomly-generated simple mathematical calculation to turn it off. The idea here is
that the app is responsible to really wake you up through a simple little mental exercise.
